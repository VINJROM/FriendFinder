### FriendFinder.js ###

# Description #
FriendFinder is an app that allows uses to find like-users based on their input. Users are shown their match based on values given to their answers.

# Motivation #
This application is part of the University of Minnesota's Web Application Development program. This particular assignment encouraged students to utilize their HTML, CSS, JavaScript, api and html-routing abilities. 

# Result #
The result is a simple mock-dating app that quickly matches users based on a set of questions.

# Improvements #
I would like to have match users based on other user input, but that's an assignment for another day!
